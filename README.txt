INSTALLATION:

* Install as any regular extension.

TRANSLATING THE EXAMPLE:

If you have a few minutes to translate the example strings into your language,
please do so on Transifex:
https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/civicrm_extensions/

After having translated the extension strings, you can download the i18nexample.mo
on the day after (there is an automatic task that fetches the strings and packages
the ".mo" file automatically, it runs daily at 9h45 PST).
